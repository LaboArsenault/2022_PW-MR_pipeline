#### COJO SLCT AND JOINT OUTPUT
Columns are : 
	chromosome; 
	SNP; 
	physical position; 
	frequency of the effect allele in the original data; 
	the effect allele; 
	effect size, standard error and p-value from the original GWAS or meta-analysis; 
	estimated effective sample size; 

	frequency of the effect allele in the reference sample; 
	effect size, standard error and p-value from a joint analysis of all the selected SNPs; 
	LD correlation between the SNP i and SNP i + 1 for the SNPs on the list.
